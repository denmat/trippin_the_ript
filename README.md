This is a pretend network scenario to test out the Ript (https://github.com/bulletproofnetworks/ript) project.

'partitions' contains pretend logical network groups.

Inside partitions you can have any number of different logical partitions configured in which ever way.

Kudos to BulletProofNetworks.

See their account for details on the DSL.
